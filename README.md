# Sudoku
Everyone knows sudoku right? Well it is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle with the objective being to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

This project was bulit with React.\
Soon I will be deploying this to web.
